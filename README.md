# snake_js

This is a simple game of snake I created by following the tutorial in the link below.
Reference: (Snake Game with JavaScript Tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je0B3nHhKmM&t=151s&ab_channel=BroCode]

I also added a few features not in the tutorial
- can move snake using W, A, S, D
- increase game speed as score increases 
- controls legend
